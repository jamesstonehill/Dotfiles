INTRODUCTION                                    *fugitive-gitlab*

This plugin to fugitive allows the |fugitive-:Gbrowse| command to
work with gitlab.com or your private gitlab instance.

See |fugitive| for documentation on |fugitive-:Gbrowse| documentation.

Additionally use |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| to omni-complete GitLab issues when
editing a commit message. This functionality is subject to change.


CONFIGURATION                                   *fugitive-gitlab-config*

To use |fugitive-:Gbrowse| with gitlab.com, no configuration is required.

To use it with a private gitlab.com, add the following to your
.vimrc

  let g:fugitive_gitlab_domains = ['https://gitlab.mydomain.com']

For |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| commit message omnicompletion of GitLab issues
and project/group members, you will need to create a GitLab access token 
https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens
with api permissions.

  let g:gitlab_api_keys = {'gitlab.com', 'token', 'gitlab.mydomain.com': 'token2'}

COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-gitlab-commands*

fugitive-gitlab does not provide any of its own commands.
See |fugitive| for its commands
